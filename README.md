# simbler
A first try to create an own language called Simbler.
This is an experiment about how would I attempt to write my own language without reading much about best practises.
So the aim is not to produce a language that can be used in production, its just a learning experience.
I tried to keep the language as simple as possible to reduce the complexity of parsing it and because of its simplicity it reminds me a bit of assembler but a simpler version of it, hence the name simbler ;)
